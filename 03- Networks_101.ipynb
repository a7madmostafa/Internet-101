    "# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals: Protocols, IP, TCP, and UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 What is a Protocol?\n",
    "A **protocol** is a **set of rules** that define how data is transmitted and received between devices on a network.  \n",
    "Think of it as a **language** that computers use to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Real-World Analogy\n",
    "Two people speaking the same language and taking turns talking are following a **communication protocol** — computers do the same thing using network protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Common Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "| Protocol | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| **HTTP / HTTPS** | Transfer web pages between browsers and servers |\n",
    "| **FTP** | Transfer files between computers |\n",
    "| **SMTP / IMAP / POP3** | Send and receive emails |\n",
    "| **TCP / UDP** | Control how data is transmitted |\n",
    "| **IP** | Route data packets to the correct destination |\n",
    "| **DNS** | Translate domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)\n",
    "An **IP address** uniquely identifies a device on a network, like a home address for computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IPv4:** `192.168.1.1` → uses 32 bits (≈ 4 billion addresses)  \n",
    "- **IPv6:** `2001:0db8::1` → uses 128 bits (virtually unlimited)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Role:\n",
    "- Routes packets between devices across networks.  \n",
    "- Works at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** The IP defines *where* to send data — like the destination address on a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)\n",
    "A **connection-oriented** protocol that ensures **reliable and ordered** delivery of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Features:\n",
    "- Establishes a connection before data transfer.  \n",
    "- Guarantees all packets arrive and in the correct order.  \n",
    "- Performs error checking and retransmission if needed.  \n",
    "- Uses flow control to prevent overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Common Uses:\n",
    "- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)  \n",
    "- Email (SMTP)  \n",
    "- File transfer (FTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like sending a **registered letter** — every piece is tracked and confirmed delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)\n",
    "A **connectionless**, **faster** protocol that sends data without ensuring delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Features:\n",
    "- No handshake or connection setup.  \n",
    "- No error recovery or flow control.  \n",
    "- Packets may arrive out of order or be lost — but it's much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Common Uses:\n",
    "- Video streaming  \n",
    "- Online gaming  \n",
    "- Voice calls (VoIP)  \n",
    "- DNS lookups  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like **broadcasting over a loudspeaker** — you send it, but you don’t know who heard it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ TCP vs UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature              | **TCP**                          | **UDP**                         |\n",
    "|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n",
    "| Connection type      | Connection-oriented              | Connectionless                  |\n",
    "| Reliability          | Reliable (acknowledged)          | Unreliable (no ACKs)            |\n",
    "| Speed                | Slower                           | Faster                          |\n",
    "| Packet order         | Maintained                       | No guarantee                    |\n",
    "| Error checking       | Yes                              | Minimal                         |\n",
    "| Typical uses         | Web, Email, File Transfer         | Video, Games, Live Streams      |\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔌 Sockets\n",
    "A **socket** is an **endpoint** for sending or receiving data across a network.  \n",
    "It connects software (applications) to the network protocols (like TCP and UDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Concept:\n",
    "A socket is defined by **IP Address + Port Number**, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "192.168.1.10:8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **IP address** → identifies the device.  \n",
    "- **Port number** → identifies the specific application/service on that device.  \n",
    "Together, they form a **unique connection point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💬 Analogy:\n",
    "- **IP address** → the building address.  \n",
    "- **Port number** → the apartment number.  \n",
    "- **Socket** → the door connecting two apartments for conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server side:**\n",
    "   - Creates a socket.\n",
    "   - Binds it to an IP and port (e.g., `0.0.0.0:5000`).\n",
    "   - Listens for incoming connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client side:**\n",
    "   - Creates its own socket.\n",
    "   - Connects to the server’s socket.\n",
    "   - Sends and receives data through that connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 Socket Types\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Protocol | Description |\n",
    "|------|-----------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Stream Socket** | **TCP** | Reliable, ordered data transmission (connection-oriented). |\n",
    "| **Datagram Socket** | **UDP** | Fast, connectionless communication (no guarantee of delivery). |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Python Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🖥️ TCP Socket Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a TCP socket\n",
    "s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n",
    "s.connect((\"example.com\", 80))\n",
    "s.send(b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\")\n",
    "response = s.recv(1024)\n",
    "print(response.decode())\n",
    "s.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "####⚡ UDP Socket Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n",
    "s.sendto(b\"Hello\", (\"127.0.0.1\", 5000))\n",
    "data, addr = s.recvfrom(1024)\n",
    "print(\"Received:\", data.decode(), \"from\", addr)\n",
    "s.close()\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🔍 How They Work Together (Example: Visiting a Website)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application Layer (HTTP)** – Browser requests a web page.  \n",
    "2. **Transport Layer (TCP)** – Breaks data into packets and ensures reliable delivery.  \n",
    "3. **Internet Layer (IP)** – Adds the destination IP address for routing.  \n",
    "4. **Network Access Layer** – Converts packets into signals (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).  \n",
    "5. **Server** – Receives and reassembles data, sends the response back.\n",

    "> - **Protocols** = communication rules.  \n",
    "> - **IP** = addressing and routing.  \n",
