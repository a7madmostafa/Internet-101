    "## 1. The Internet Itself\n",
    "The **Internet** is a huge network of computers all connected together.  \n",
    "Every computer (or ‚Äúdevice‚Äù) that connects to the Internet has an **IP address**, like a home address, so data knows where to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How Communication Happens: Request ‚Üí Response\n",
    "When you visit a website (e.g. `www.google.com`), your computer:\n",
    "1. **Sends a Request** asking for a page.\n",
    "2. The web server **sends a Response** containing the page‚Äôs data (HTML, images, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This ‚Äúrequest‚Äìresponse‚Äù cycle is the foundation of web communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. DNS: Turning Names into Addresses\n",
    "Humans use names (`www.google.com`),  \n",
    "but the Internet uses IP addresses (`142.250.190.68`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS (Domain Name System)** is like a phonebook ‚Äî it translates domain names into IP addresses before your browser can connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. TCP/IP: The Internet‚Äôs Core Protocols\n",
    "Communication happens using two key layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **IP (Internet Protocol)**\n",
    "- Handles **addressing and routing**.  \n",
    "- Decides *where* data packets go (like envelopes traveling through post offices).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**\n",
    "- Ensures **reliable delivery**.  \n",
    "- Breaks data into **packets**, numbers them, sends them, and reassembles them at the destination.  \n",
    "- Resends any lost packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they form **TCP/IP**, the foundation of Internet communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. HTTP: How the Web Works\n",
    "**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the **language** browsers and web servers use to communicate over TCP/IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example flow:\n",
    "Browser: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Server: 200 OK (returns HTML content)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTP request**: asks for a resource (page, image, etc.)\n",
    "- **HTTP response**: sends back the data + status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern sites often use **HTTPS**, which adds encryption (SSL/TLS) for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Ports: Entry Points for Communication\n",
    "A **port** is like a specific ‚Äúdoor‚Äù on a computer for a certain type of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Protocol | Default Port | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| HTTP      | 80           | Web traffic |\n",
    "| HTTPS     | 443          | Secure web traffic |\n",
    "| FTP       | 21           | File transfer |\n",
    "| SSH       | 22           | Secure shell access |\n",
    "\n",
    "A full address looks like:  \n",
    "`192.168.1.5:80` ‚Üí IP address + port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Putting It All Together (Example)\n",
    "You type `https://example.com`:\n",
    "1. **DNS lookup** ‚Üí find IP address of `example.com`.\n",
    "2. Browser connects to **server‚Äôs IP via TCP**, using port **443**.\n",
    "3. Sends an **HTTP request** (GET `/`).\n",
    "4. Server sends **HTTP response** (HTML data).\n",
    "5. Browser renders the webpage.\n",
