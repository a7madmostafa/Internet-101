# 🌐 Internet 101

A concise summary of **how the Internet works**, inspired by [*Django for Everybody* course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0XbHvKxw7Y).

Covers the main ideas from the **first hour** of the lecture — the foundation of web development before frameworks like Django.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How clients, servers, and HTTP interact  
- The meaning and structure of URLs  
- How sockets enable data transfer  
- Why Internet standards (IETF, W3C) matter  

## 🚀 Why It’s Important
Understanding how browsers talk to servers makes Django and other frameworks much clearer — you’ll know what happens *under the hood* when a page loads.
